Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed! Give us some good news. How are things looking for us in terms sales this month?\\n: Uh well. . . would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?\\n: What? Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news!\\n: Well sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, fifty percent in the past month alone. We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It's a real mess.\\n: For crying out loud. . . How fast are we losing money?\\n: Um. . . how can I put this? Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months.\\n: What! Geez! How could this have happened? So what's the bad news?\\n: Oh, that's the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty. We're going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We're going to have to shoulder this cost.\\n: Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now! They have to assume the costs of this mess!\\n: We tried that, sir. The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.\\n: We're doomed!\\n: There is some really good news though!\\n: Really? What!\\n: I got offered a new job!\",\n          \": I need a taxi, please.\\n: We have various transportation services. Would you prefer a private vehicle?\\n: No, thanks.

Click here for a full report of the game David Moyes was treated to with 10 players booked, two sent off, both coaches dismissed . David Moyes stepped up his quest for summer signings by flying to Lisbon to make a personal check on at least three top transfer targets. Knowing he will be armed with a massive budget for team strengthening at the end of the season, the Manchester United manager attended Porto\\u2019s Portugal Cup semi-final with Benfica at the Estadio da Luz, in an attempt to narrow down a long list of candidates to bolster his side in all areas. Sportsmail understands the two players under closest review were highly-rated centre-back Eliaquim Mangala and his Porto team-mate Jackson Martinez. In addition, Moyes has also been alerted to the form of Benfica\\u2019s on-loan left-back Guilherme Siqueira and was keen to see him in action. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Moyes's Manchester United targets in action . Top target: David Moyes is in Portugal to watch Eliaquim Mangala (right) in action for Porto . Fiery tussle: Mangala battles with Benfica keeper Artur Moraes as Porto lost 3-1 in a mach which saw two sent off and both coaches dismissed . Future team-mates? Benfica's Guilherme Siqueira (left) vies for the ball with Porto's Jackson Martinez . Together again: Siqueira (left) attempts to grasp with Martinez in the Portuguese Cup semi-final . Mindful that Mangala is also being seriously considered by Manchester City, as Manuel Pellegrini looks to bring in a suitable defensive partner for skipper Vincent Kompany, Moyes seized the opportunity to run the rule over the lynchpin of Porto\\u2019s back four before deciding whether to follow up his interest with a bid. He is evidently reluctant to meet the central defender\\u2019s \\u00a337.8million buy-out clause but may take the chance to sound out Porto officials to see if there is room for manoeuvre. Man in the stands: United boss Moyes, pictured here watching Fleetwood Town vs Chesterfield last October, was watching in Lisbon . Moving on? Fabio Coentrao gestures to Neymar in the Copa del Rey final... but will the Portuguese be joining Manchester United? Top target: United are chasing the signature of Luke Shaw - and will tempt Southampton with a \\u00a330m offer . Colombia marksman Martinez has established himself as one of the Portuguese League\\u2019s most prolific finishers, to such a degree that he has attracted the attention of Roma, Arsenal and Chelsea, as well as United, in recent weeks. Moyes has long been linked with Real Madrid left-back Fabio Coentrao and is closing in on Southampton\\u2019s Luke Shaw, as revealed in Sportsmail. But as a contingency plan, he is keeping an eye on the form of Siqueira, who is on loan at Benfica from Granada.\",\n          \"In her last moments before embarking on a 15-month prison sentence for bankruptcy fraud, Teresa Giudice savored a $1.95 hot egg sandwich in a diner near the penitentiary. The Real Housewives of New Jersey star spent her last free hour at Elmer's Diner in Danbury in the early hours of Monday morning, where she spent most of the time saying goodbye to friends and checking her cell phone, according to\\u00a0TMZ. At midnight, Giudice's attorney James J Leonard Jr picked her up at her lavish mansion to drive her to the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut . Scoll down for video . Savoring the taste: Teresa Giudice enjoyed a $1.95 egg sandwich and coffee at a local diner before jail . Saying goodbye: Diners said Giudice spent most of her time in the diner saying goodbye to friends . A last look: She also enjoyed some precious time on her cell phone before going to her daughter's party . It was a quick pit stop for the Real Housewives star after arriving early to her daughter's party . On her final day of freedom she went to church service and then squeezed in an early 14th birthday celebration for her daughter Gia. For Gia's party - two days before her actual birthday - they had 'cake and a celebration,' sources told\\u00a0Us Weekly. Teresa then made the lonely trip, leaving her husband Giuseppe 'Joe' Giudice at home with their four daughters. He will care for them until Teresa's release and then he will begin his own 41-month sentence for similar charges. Mr Leonard said the 41-year-old reality star was not tearful and instead was 'very upbeat and very positive - she was anxious to get it started.' Teresa Giudice hid in the back seat of an SUV as she left $4million Towaco mansion in the middle of the night to surrender at a federal prison and begin her 15-month prison sentence for bankruptcy fraud .

Explaining her decision to surrender early rather than at the usual time of 7am, he said: 'She wanted to spare her family and not have a spectacle.' The Atlantic City-based attorney told MailOnline her early arrival was pre-planned and the staff at the prison were all very 'polite and cordial.' He said Teresa took in $200 and a folder of legal documents. 'I gave her rosary beads and a necklace of Saint Christopher and Saint Teresa,' he added. Mr Leonard said the last thing his client said to him was, 'Tell everybody I'll be fine.' He explained a first visit for immediate family is this weekend and Joe will be allowed to visit.

On Monday morning Joe was pictured driving out of the family home in New Jersey to take their daughters to school. The photos caused a buzz on social media as in October Joe  pleaded guilty in state court to unlawful use of identification in a case involving a bogus driver's license. His 18-month sentence will run concurrent with his federal sentence. MailOnline has contacted his lawyer for a response. On Monday morning his mother was also seen driving out the home a few hours later. On Sunday Teresa attended mass with her family at the Sacred Hearth Church in New Jersey. The reality star smiled at her four bundled-up daughters - Gia, 13; Gabriella, 10; Milania, 8; and Audriana, 5. Teresa is now serving time in the same Connecticut penitentiary where Piper Herman set her memoir Orange Is the New Black and Lauryn Hill did three months for tax evasion in 2013. People reports that the raven-haired socialite's first moments will involve a strip search and a 'squat and cough' to see if she is hiding anything. The former Celebrity Apprentice contestant will have to pay for up to 300 minutes a month of precious evening phone time.

The food on sale includes hummus, honey roasted peanuts, party mix and vanilla chai tea. Teresa told Bravo co-star Dina Manzo during a bizarre resolutions-themed Haute Hostess video for Glam.com\\u00a0that she plans to cut back on carbohydrates as her New Year's resolution. But according to Radar Online, her resolution may be tricky to uphold on a prison diet. Breakfast is a fresh orange, hot oatmeal, three slices of bread, a margarine pat, two packages of jelly and two cups of skim milk. When lunch is served Teresa will be tucking into beans and franks, potatoes, two mustard packets, three slices of bread, two margarine pats, a fresh apple and a drink. And dinner will be a fish filet, tomato sauce, white rice, lima beans, two tartar sauce packets, three slices of bread, two margarine packets, a fresh apple, and again another drink. Meanwhile Teresa will only be allowed 12 visits per month with her family, and she'll likely have to work in the prison factory. Wake-up is at 6am and Giudice will report to her prison-assigned job from 8am-3pm. On Saturday, her teenage daughter tweeted 'can't sleep, to much stuff on my mind,' along with a nervous face and gun emojis. On New Year's Day, Gia shared a snap with her mother captioned: 'Happy New Years with my best friend!! @Teresa_Giudice.' Teresa Giudice told Dina Manzo that she wants to give up bad carbs in 2015 . Teresa told Bravo co-star Dina Manzo during a bizarre resolutions-themed Haute Hostess video for Glam.com\\u00a0that she plans to cut back on carbohydrates as her New Year's resolution.

And dinner will be a fish filet, tomato sauce, white rice, lima beans, two tartar sauce packets, three slices of bread, two margarine packets, a fresh apple, and again another drink. Giudice's last public event was watching her eldest perform with her girl-group 3KT at Iplay America in Freehold. The New York Times best-selling author has been spending her final days before surrender with her princesses - at a hockey game and a ski trip to Crystal Springs Resort. 'My family is probably one of the strongest families I know,' her daughter Gia - who's shopping around a reality show - told\\u00a0Access Hollywood in November. 'So we'll get through this. It's gonna be fine. And when it's over, we're gonna be better than ever.' The Real Housewives of New Jersey star has told daughters Gia and Gabriella about the family's legal woes, but she's reportedly keeping her incarceration a secret from her youngest girls. 'She told [Milania and Audriana] she is going to jail to work on a book about jail,' a source told Radar Online. 'Teresa and Joe feel that they are too young to fully comprehend what is going on.' They pleaded guilty last year to hiding assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitting phony loan applications to get some $5 million in mortgages and construction loans. Joe  also pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes totaling more than $200,000. At the Giudices' sentencing in October, U.S. District Judge Esther Salas criticized the couple for not disclosing all their assets as required under their plea agreement, calling it 'the same pattern of obstruction, concealment and manipulation as they showed in the bankruptcy case.' Still, Salas sentenced Teresa to a sentence below the range sought by the U.S. attorney's office and staggered her sentence with her husband's so they wouldn't be in prison at the same time and unable to care for their four daughters. Joe is not an American citizen, and he faces an immigration hearing when he completes his sentence and is expected to be deported. His attorney has said Giudice came to the U.S. as an infant and did not know he was not an American citizen until he was an adult. Last month, Teresa Giudice sued former attorney James Kridel, whose firm handled the couple's bankruptcy case, alleging legal malpractice and negligence. Reached by phone last week, Kridel called the lawsuit 'ridiculous' and denied the claims. 'We did what we were supposed to do,' he said. 'We can only rely on the facts that were provided to us. I don't wish her any ill will, but I would have preferred a 'thank you' rather than a lawsuit.'\",\n          \"Daughter of the late Whitney Houston, Bobbi Kristina, 21, was hospitalized after being found unconscious in a bathtub at home on January 31 . Doctors were unable to take Bobbi Kristina out of her medically-induced coma on Wednesday. The 21-year-old, who is on life support at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, began having seizures when they began taking her off various medications,\\u00a0CNN reports. It was then decided to keep her in the coma. Whitney Houston's daughter remains in a serious condition after being found unconscious in a bathtub at her home on January 31. Last week, she was given a tracheotomy. Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, Bobby Brown, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition. The news came amid ruptures between Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, and her father, R&B artist Bobby Brown. On Monday, Gordon went on an extraordinary Twitter rant against Brown - claiming he has hardly seen his 21-year-old daughter in years before she was taken to hospital and was only interested in the family's money. Gordon, who has reportedly been banned from visiting Bobbi Kristina, told Brown to 'grow up' - insisting she will hate him when she wakes up. The angry tirade came hours after attorneys from the Brown family told Gordon he will not be allowed at her bedside until he reveals exactly what happened the evening before Bobbi Kristina was found face down in a bathtub. Gordon also insisted he has taken care of his girlfriend '24/7' since her mother died in 2012. On Monday, he first tweeted: 'Okay, so I'll probably get in trouble for this,' before uploading a screenshot of damning text messages he claimed to have sent Bobby Brown. The first, underneath a picture of the new Bobbi Kristina tattoo on his right arm, read: 'Man to man I love your daughter.' He added: 'I don't know why you won't let me see her. Grow up. Your daughter is going to hate you when she wakes up.' Scroll down for video . Bobby Brown (pictured right earlier this month) said his daughter's boyfriend Nick Gordon (pictured left) has been lying about trying to visit her in the hospital . The 21-year-old \\u00a0is on life support at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia . The messages were quickly deleted from his profile, however he continued to shame Bobby Brown's parenting skills. He wrote: 'Crazy how all the Browns came to the hospital when this went down. I've been with her 24/7 watching over her and mom. Bobby left when it got heavy. Gordon then claimed: 'Bobby seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs.' He added: 'Now him and his family want Whitneys $$$ which belongs to Krissi or Cissy.' His followers quickly got involved in the conversation, some sharing messages of support and others were what he described as 'negative allegations'. 'Listen at the end of all this I took care of Whitney Houston and Kriss which was very hard on someone my age' he wrote. 'They cried on my shoulders!!!!' 'Grow up': Gordon uploaded a screenshot of text messages he allegedly sent to Bobby Brown. In them he insisted Bobbi Kristina will hate her father when she wakes up . Motivation: The 22-year-old claims the Brown family only want the money from Whitney Ho . Parenting: Gordon accused Bobby Brown of virtually deserting his daughter during the rant . Referring to the night she was hospitalized, he said: 'My only regret is not getting to [Bobbi] faster to give CPR.' On Sunday, he posted: 'I can't wait till she wakes up and dismiss all of the negative thoughts. There is a reason why her mom made me promise to look after her.' Bobbi Kristina, the only daughter of the late Whitney Houston has been hospitalized in Atlanta since being found unresponsive on January 31 in a tub at her Georgia home. Police said Gordon was performing CPR when emergency responders arrived at the home. Gordon tweeted in anger on Saturday, saying he had been denied access to visit his 21-year-old girlfriend. 'Let me in the hospital to see my girl and let her hear my voice SHE WILL WAKE UP!!!' he tweeted on Saturday. Hope: Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend is still optimistic that she will wake up from the medically-induced coma she has been in \\u00a0for the last three weeks . Regrets: Referring to the night she was found face down in a bathtub, he told his followers he wishes he could have done more to save her. Police said they arrived and found him giving CPR . A lawyer for Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown, said in a statement on Sunday that Bobbi Kristina's partner, Nick Gordon, was offered an opportunity to potentially visit her if he agreed to meet certain conditions. 'Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe. At least not desperate enough to inform Bobby Brown, in writing, what happened to Bobbi Kristina,' attorney Christopher Brown told\\u00a0E!. But Gordon's attorneys said R&B singer Brown has consistently denied Gordon permission to visit. They said they advised Gordon not to agree to the conditions set by Brown. The conditions have not been made public. The attorneys said Gordon has repeatedly offered to discuss the issue privately with Brown. According to NBC, Brown's statement said that because Gordon had failed to spell out what happened to Bobbi Kristina, 'there is no reason for any additional discussion with him'. Reports have suggested Gordon may by the subject of a police investigation after police found 'suspicious injuries' on Bobbi Kristina in hospital. Sources have claimed that Bobbi Kristina used drugs as she was 'distraught' over the death of her mother Whitney Houston three years earlier (mother and daughter pictured together at a Grammys party in 2011) Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized earlier this month, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. A new report which surfaced last week claimed that Bobbi Kristina  was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub. In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident, according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claimed, and still was 'distraught' over her mother's death three years ago. One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words'. Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. Gordon reportedly has become the main focus in a criminal investigation by police in Roswell, Georgia. Prior to being hospitalized, Bobbi Kristina had been in a car crash, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said. The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said. One of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29934,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Chelsea drew 1-1 away at PSG in the Champions League on Tuesday night .\\nRoy Keane was working as a pundit for ITV's coverage .\\nSir Alex Ferguson attended the Parc des Princes as part of work for UEFA .\",\n          \"NBC renews \\\"Celebrity Apprentice\\\" despite Donald Trump's possible White House bid .\\nIf he runs, somebody else will sit \\\"at the head of the boardroom table,\\\" NBC's Bob Greenblatt says .\\nTrump says he'll make his intentions known at the end of the current season .\",\n          \"Shows including A Midsummer Night\\u2019s Dream, the Lion King and The Mousetrap attracted 22million spectators in one year .\\nJust under 14million football fans attended the 380 Premier League matches last season .\\nFigures not surprising: football season runs from August to May, whereas theatre shows can be shown twice a day and up to seven days a week .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

i'm very happy. we've been talking about coming here and i'm happy to be here. done deal: liverpool signing mario balotelli poses with the shirt after switching to anfield in a \\u00a316million deal . what attracted you to the challenge here at liverpool? liverpool are one of the best teams here in england. the football is very good here. it's a great team with young players, and that's why i came here. you've received an incredible reception from the fans here already. how has that made you feel? i didn't expect it because i've always been playing against liverpool. whenever i played against liverpool, the fans weren't nice with me but that's normal - it's football! now that i play for liverpool, i can see the expectation in people. they're very happy and that makes me very happy at the same time. unexpected: balotelli admitted liverpool fans weren't nice with him during his time playing for manchester city . you've previously described playing at anfield as a 'beautiful experience' to fabio borini. did you enjoy playing at anfield as an opposing player? no - but when i play with this team [at anfield], it's going to be nice for sure. to play here for liverpool excites me, but if you're an opponent it's difficult. for someone still so young, you have a lot of experience - can you use that to help what is a young team here at liverpool? i maybe have a little bit more experience than other players - if i can help them, i'm happy to help them. pen to paper: italy international balotelli has signed a three-year deal with the reds worth \\u00a3125,000-a-week . liverpool are back in the champions league after five years out, and you have got great memories of the competition; you were inter milan's youngest ever goalscorer in the tournament and you also won it with them in 2010. are those experiences something you can bring to liverpool to help in the champions league this season? i always start a competition wanting to win it. we will see. i want to win another champions league for sure, because the champions league wasn't all mine, i was in a team. i want to take this team to the champions league. you have been away from english football for around 18 months - how do you feel about coming back? i'm happy to be back because i left england and it was a mistake. i wanted to go to italy but i realised it was a mistake. regret: balotelli admits it was a mistake to leave england when he left man city for ac milan in january 2013 . do you feel english football suits you better? english football is generally better. english football is beautiful. we know you are going to take the no.45 for liverpool. can you explain the significance of that shirt? when i first played three or four games with inter milan, when i was young, i had no.45 because the numbers for young players were from no.36 to no.50. i took no.45 because i was joking that four plus five is nine - and i scored in all four games. it brings me luck and that's why i've always kept no.45. this deal has moved very quickly over the last few days, so has it sunk in yet that you are a liverpool player? no. when i meet the team, start training with them and start my first game, i will realise. for now, i have just seen the city. superstition: balotelli insists wearing the no 45 shirt brings him luck on the pitch . how much are you looking forward to meeting your new teammates? i am going to meet them soon and i'm excited. liverpool are in action tonight against your former club, manchester city - are you going to attend the game? i'm going to be watching the game. i would love to play but i can't, so i'll support them from the stand. finally, what are your ambitions here at liverpool?

       "'zurich, switzerland (cnn) -- top international soccer officials are meeting thursday in switzerland to discuss whether to change the dates for the 2022 world cup tournament in qatar from summer to winter amid concerns over heat. the two-day meeting of fifa\\'s executive committee in zurich will also consider allegations that migrant workers employed on huge world cup-related construction projects are being abused. dozens of workers\\' rights protesters, waving flags and brandishing red cards, gathered outside the complex ahead of the meeting as they delivered a letter to fifa president sepp blatter calling on soccer\\'s world governing body to ensure fair labor practices. a fifa official took the letter inside, saying that fifa is taking the matter seriously. members of the executive committee, known as exco, declined to answer reporters\\' questions as they entered. in addition to the issues of qatar\\'s summer heat and concerns over labor conditions, the committee is expected to hear an update from qatar 2022 organizers on their preparations for the world cup. fifa has been considering the option of moving the tournament because of fears that players and fans could be adversely affected by temperatures that sometimes reach 122 degrees fahrenheit during the summer. all 54 member associations of uefa, europe\\'s governing body, last month voted against holding the tournament in the qatari summer, adding to speculation that a move to the winter was in prospect. but a winter world cup would cause chaos with the european domestic season, with many clubs fearing they could lose out financially. decision, or no decision? the final decision lies with fifa\\'s executive committee. its verdict had been widely expected to come friday -- but uefa president michel platini has reportedly cast doubt on that. \"there will be no decision. it is impossible,\" he is quoted by britain\\'s daily telegraph newspaper as saying wednesday in zurich. platini reportedly added that he was \"much more concerned\" by the allegations of abusive labor practices in qatar than the question of when the tournament is played. fifa said last week that it would raise the issue of workers\\' rights with the qatari authorities and that the executive committee would discuss claims that migrant workers are being exploited. a cnn report in may highlighted allegations by rights groups that thousands of construction workers building the infrastructure for the 2022 world cup have been abused, denied their wages and trapped in a situation from which they cannot escape because, under qatar\\'s visa system, they cannot leave the country without their employer\\'s consent. allegations made by the guardian newspaper last week added to concerns. the world professional footballers association, fifpro, said that \"qatar must respect the rights of the key people who will deliver the 2022 fifa world cup: the workers who build the world cup stadia and infrastructure and the professional footballers who play in them.\" the qatar 2022 supreme committee has said it is committed to ensuring workers\\' safety and well being. labor ministry: more inspectors, translators . ali al khulaifi, an international relations adviser at qatar\\'s ministry of labor and social affairs, told cnn that qatar is taking concrete steps to ensure its labor rules are enforced, including making it easier for workers to report abuses by their employers. \"we have a plan to double the number of inspectors by the end of the year,\" he said. \"since many of the migrant workers don\\'t speak arabic, we are hiring translators to submit complaints.\" the ministry of labor says it plans to increase the number of branches it has from the current two in the capital, doha, and five outside, but has not given details. conditions for workers in qatar have come under increased scrutiny since a report in the guardian last week alleging that dozens of nepali migrant laborers died there over the summer. \"we are a member of the ilo (international labour organization). we have ratified the forced labor convention. so we\\'re hiring an international firm to look into the allegations,\" al khulaifi said . \"work-related deaths are really unfortunate. but the numbers are less than what was published.\" he said the ministry would investigate any claims that some companies are holding the passports of workers, preventing them from leaving, as has been alleged. the ministry has commissioned an international law firm, dla piper, to carry out independent investigation into the allegations and report back to the government, the state-run qatar news agency reported wednesday. legal action threatened . the question of any shift in the calendar for the 2022 qatar world cup -- or, more drastically, any move to take it away from the wealthy gulf nation -- will be closely watched around the world. australia, which lost out to qatar along with south korea, the united states and japan, believes it should be compensated if the world cup is held in the winter rather than the summer and has threatened legal action. a move to the winter months could also have big cost implications for european clubs and for broadcasters. moving matches means shifting many of the events that the latter have paid multimillions for and, importantly, would be wanting to tie up in contracts for the future. blatter, the fifa president, recently said that it would not be feasible to hold a summer world cup in qatar. but qatar disagrees. hassan al-thawadi, secretary general of the qatar 2022 supreme committee, told cnn last week that it is \"absolutely not\" too hot during the summer to stage the tournament then. he acknowledged that summer in his country is hot, but said, \"other nations have hosted similar world cups in similar if not more severe conditions.\" in addition, he said, qatar is investing in cooling technologies for stadiums, training areas and fan areas. this, he said, \"adds more confidence to us in terms of our ability to host a very successful and very memorable world cup.\" cnn\\'s alex thomas reported from zurich and leone lakhani from doha, while laura smith-spark wrote in london. cnn\\'s schams elwazer contributed to this report.'"
